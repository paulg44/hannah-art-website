# hannah-art-website

Deployed site => https://www.hannahjanegarton.netlify.app

A e-commerce style website for my partner, a talented amateur artist and illustrator. I made this site so Hannah can take control over her products and if she wishes have a place to sell her pieces of art. 
The site is currently fully functional. However, as it was a surprise for her birthday we are still in the progress of updating the product catalogue on Stripe. Products do appear on the deployed site, they are just placeholders for now.

# Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Payment integration: Stripe
Testing: React Testing Library and Cypress

# Learnings

I've learnt mostly about the Stripe API in this process. Working through the docs, adding products and prices etc. 
Also I feel my debugging skills have gotten much better during this project, especially when deploying the backend and having CORS issues. I managed to sort these issues by looking at the Render & Stripe logs and through the network tab inspection on developer tools. 

# Continued development

- add a favourite to each piece to save in local storage
- finish the CSS with more animations
- complete suite of tests including mocks and E2E test
- more Stripe integration
