# hannah-art-website

This is a website for my partner to display and sell her art (she doesn;t know, it's for her birthday!)

In this project I will be using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with bootstrap or tailwind for responsiveness.
I will use Stripe for the payment service and it should not need a backend.

As this is a very basic application, pretty much one or two pages there's not a lot of need for a framework like
React. In this way I hope to learn more about recent HTML additions such as the pop over, localStorage (liking a piece), 
and also I will be trying something new, to me, with the navigation at the side of the screen, using icons that transform
to text. Lastly, I will be diving deeper into the Stripe API and looking inot adding a basket and multiple items.

All subject to change, but thats a good start!
